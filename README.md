# KMSAuto Net 1.8.7 for Windows and Office
**KMSauto Net** is an automatic activator for Microsoft products such as Windows and Office. It uses the KMS (Key Management Service) protocol to activate Microsoft products without the need to purchase a license. It activates Office suites, client and server operating systems in one click in several ways. The activator allows you to install and uninstall KMS services, perform automatic re-activation, and install your own keys.

## Suitable for what?
KMSAuto includes tools for administration, changing OS editions, working with keys for:
- Windows Vista - 10, 11 (VL - Volume License edition only);
- Windows Server 2008 - 2021;
- Office 2010 - 365.

## KMSAuto activator modes
KMSAuto Net works in three modes, which are accessed through the “Main Window” tab.
- **Activation** - automatic implementation of a mechanism that will allow you to successfully authenticate the “operating system” or office programs. The application consistently applies available activates methods until activation is successfully completed. Additionally, it will display information about Windows/Office license status: product name, version, identifier, computer IP address, activation date, reactivation periodicity.
- **Manual Key Installation** - Allows you to enter your own GVLK keys through a pre-installed KMS node via the GUI rather than the command line. Supports deleting installed keys and adding custom keys.
- **Scheduler** - will implement tasks for reactivation. The authenticity of products is checked every 30 days, so the developer has provided automatic activation with a periodicity of 10 days, but it can be changed in the scheduler library.

### Settings
The settings tab is intended for advanced users. It allows you to:
- Change the parameters of the KMS service and the port used to communicate with it.
- Restore the previously used IP address.
- Switch the program interface languages to **Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, English**.
- Install/uninstall KMS-services.

**In KMSAuto you can maintain and export log files in xlsx format, change product activation methods or select automatic mode - the program will determine the appropriate method without user intervention.**

### Utilities tab
The Utilities tab contains tools for Windows administration:
- **Services** - opens the application for managing installed services.
- **Scheduler** - opens the tool where you can add and edit scheduled tasks.
- **Accounts** - opens a window for managing profiles.
- **Event Viewer** - will display the system event log.
- **Authenticate** system files.

**KMSAuto Net is used to change the edition or release of the operating system. This function is useful when you have purchased a key for one version of Windows and are using a different version. If there are problems with Microsoft Office, the package can be completely removed from the computer with registry keys and licenses via KMSAuto. There is a function to remove the “Invalid System” status, which occurs after the key expires when the key fails authentication or when using an unactivated product. It will remove the corresponding inscription on the Desktop and prevent the appearance of windows with information about the use of unlicensed software.**

## Additionally
KMSAuto++ includes a number of auxiliary utilities.
1. **Microsoft Defender Tools** - disable/enable Windows Defender, add directories or disks to exceptions.
2. **Uninstall Microsoft Office** - utility to completely uninstall office from your computer.
3. **Show or Hide Updates** - allows you to hide reminders about OS updates or software updates installed on your computer.
4. **MSActBackUp** - tiny assistant to backup/restore the state of information about licenses detected on your computer. Allows you to save the license for later use on other devices or after reinstalling the operating system.
